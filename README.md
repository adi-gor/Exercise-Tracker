# Exercise-Tracker
This Web App keeps track of different exercises performed by users. A Stopwatch keeps track of the total duration (in minutes) of the exercise. Users can store details such as exercise type, total duration and date. Authentication is done using auth0. Users can also listen to a workout playlist right from the app.
